# Types of operators

# 1. Arithmetic operators
 # Addition: +
 # Subtraction: -
 # Multiplication: *
 # Division: /
 # Floor division: //
 # Exponentiation: **
 # Modulo: %
 
 
 # 2. Assignment operators
 # Assignment: =
 # Addition assignment: +=
 # Subtraction assignment: -=
 # Multiplication assignment: *=
 # Division assignment: /=
 # Floor division assignment: //=
 # Exponentiation assignment: **=
 # Modulo assignment: %=
 
 # 3. Comparison/Relational operators :Always returns boolean value 
 # Equal to: ==
 # Not equal to: !=
 # Greater than: >
 # Greater than or equal to: >=
 # Less than: <
 # Less than or equal to: <=
 
 # 4. Logical operators
 # AND: and
 # OR: or
 # NOT: not
 
 # 5. Bitwise operators
 # Bitwise AND: &
 # Bitwise OR: |
 # Bitwise XOR: ^
 # Bitwise left shift: <<
 # Bitwise right shift: >>
